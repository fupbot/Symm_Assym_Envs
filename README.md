Gazebo maps for the experiments listed on the IEEE Latam article entitled "Analysis of Local Trajectory Planners for Mobile Robot with Robot Operating System"

The first simulation world (the one with the obstacle shaped like a letter 'U') is intended to test a robot's ability to find a path in a situation where two trajectories have approximate costs.

The second world has randomly placed obstacles that test the robot's ability to navigate in a more life-like scenario.
