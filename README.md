# sym_asym_maps
Gazebo maps for the experiments listed on the IEEE Latam article entitled "Analysis of Local Trajectory Planners for Mobile Robot with Robot Operating System" available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9662177 <br>

The first simulation world "asym_map.world", which has an obstacle shaped like a letter 'U', is intended to test a robot's ability to find a path in a situation where two trajectories have approximate costs.<br>

The second world "sym_map.world" has randomly placed obstacles that test the robot's ability to navigate in a more life-like scenario<br>.
